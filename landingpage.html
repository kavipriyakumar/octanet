                    Jewellery has the power to be this one little thing that can make you feel unique.
                    Accessories are like vitamins to fashion-as such, you should use them liberally.
                    If there was a chance of spending lots of money on accessories or dress ,I always choose accessories.
                    I think jewellery can change an outfit more than anything else.
                    The object of the passion is just an accesory to the passion itself.

              <h1>A plain sponge cake doesn’t look like much until it’s jazzed up with frosting and toppings. In the same way, fashion accessories give flavor to an ordinary looking outfit. 

                Accessories are often considered investments by most women and men because these pieces add personality to an outfit and offer so many more opportunities to showcase an individual sense of style. They may be small items, but they have the power to complete one's look while exuding their taste, style, and preferences. </h1>
